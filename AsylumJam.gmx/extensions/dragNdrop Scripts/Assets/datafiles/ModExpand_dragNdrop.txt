IF YOU NEED TO MODIFY THE CODE FOR ANY REASON, PLEASE BE SURE TO MAKE BACKUP COPIES OF THE ORIGINAL CODE FIRST.

Also, take some time to read the comments and code for ALL dragNdrop scripts. The code has been created with
maintainability in mind, so it should be simple to modify or create new scripts using the existing scripts.
I recommend that you DO NOT attempt to modify any of these scripts until you clearly understand how they use
each other to move objects.

With that said, the scripts "scr_dragNdrop" and "scr_dragNdrop_ext" will be great references when creating or
expanding drag-and-drop capabilities for your project. All scripts named "scr_dNd_*" are helper scripts that
perform a specific task (relevant to their own name).



-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are 9 scripts in total (for now) that call each other, so take care when/if modifying them:
-	scr_dragNdrop
-	scr_dragNdrop_ext
-	scr_dNd_drag
-	scr_dNd_drop
-	scr_dNd_getDist
-	scr_dNd_getManager
-	scr_dNd_snap
-	scr_dNd_snapBack
-	scr_dNd_snapTo
