This package contains several scripts (referred to as "dragNdrop" or "dragNdrop scripts") that simplify the process of adding
drag-and-drop functionality to an object.

BEFORE using any of the dragNdrop scripts, read the following:
	-	"Using_dragNdrop.txt"		//how to setup/use dragNdrop scripts
	-	"ModExpand_dragNdrop.txt"	//modifying/expanding dragNdrop scripts



-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Please note that the asset package you have received also contains a demo of the scripts setup and working. Some of the assets
included are not important to the use of dragNdrop scripts and can be removed before going into your project(s); however, you will
need to create a new asset package with the extraneous assets removed to avoid having to remove assets for each project that uses
dragNdrop scripts.
