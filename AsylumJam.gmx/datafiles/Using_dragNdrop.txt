For the most part you can use these 2 scripts for drag-and-drop functionality:
	-	scr_dragNdrop(objToMove, dragDepth)
	-	scr_dragNdrop_ext(objToMove, dragDepth, mouseDragIcon, snap_obj, snap_x, snap_y, maxDistX, maxDistY)

However there may come a time when you need/want something different; so 7 individual functions were created to allow for easier
modifications to give you more control over how objects are dragged/dropped.
(Read "ModExpand_dragNdrop.txt" for more info)



-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Setting up a PROJECT to be compatible with dragNdrop scripts:

	1. The object "obj_dragNdrop_Mngr" must be included in the resource tree of a project.
			--	obj_dragNdrop_Mngr can be found in the folder "dragNdrop Manager" under objects
				in the resource tree
			--	All rooms must contain ONE (and only 1) instance of "obj_dragNdrop_Mngr"
            If one does not exist, then an instance of "obj_dragNdrop_Mngr" will automatically be created



-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Setting up an OBJECT to be compatible with dragNdrop scripts:

	1. [creation event] Add the following 4 variables to your object:
			--	is_dragNdrop = 0;    //any object that uses the scr_dragNdrop script(s) MUST have the vars "is_dragNdrop" AND "id_dragNdrop"
			--	id_dragNdrop = -1;   //must set id_dragNdrop to -1 to avoid dragNdrop object id clashes (as in 2 instances having the same id_dragNdrop value)
         
         --	isSingleDrop = 0;    //set this to 1 here if the object should only be allowed to drag and drop once
			--	isLocked = 0;        //this variable will automatically be changed to 1 (locked) after the object has been moved
                                 //if the isSingleDrop var is set to 1
         
         
         //if you plan on using the script scr_dragNdrop_ext(), you will also need to add the following 5 variables to your
         //object here in the creation event:
         
         -- SnapObject = Obj_Name;     //SnapObject is used to hold the name of a specific object to snap to
         
         -- cursorToUse = spr_Cursor;  //"cursorToUse" is a var that holds a sprite to use as a cursor while dragging an object
                                       //set to -1 to NOT use a custom cursor)
         
         -- drop_MaxDistX = 40;        //"drop_MaxDistX" is used to set the max distance (in pixels) on the x-axis allowed between
                                       //the dragged object and the object to snap to
         -- drop_MaxDistY = 40;        //"drop_MaxDistY" is used to set the max distance (in pixels) on the y-axis allowed between
                                       //the dragged object and the object to snap to
         
         -- drag_Depth = 10000;        //drag_Depth is used to give the object being dragged a specific depth while being dragged
                                       //(original depth will be restored when the object is dropped)
	
   
   
	2. [step event] Add the following code:
			--	//check if the dragNdrop script is already running
				if (self.is_dragNdrop = 1)
				{
					//run the scr_dragNdrop script
					scr_dragNdrop(objToMove, dragDepth);
													
					//OR...........
					
					//run the scr_dragNdrop_ext script
					scr_dragNdrop_ext(objToMove, dragDepth, mouseDragIcon, snap_obj, snap_x, snap_y, maxDistX, maxDistY);
				}
	
   
   
	//step 3 code can be added to whatever your trigger is for using drag-and-drop (in this case, the left mouse button press event)
	3. [left press event] Add the following code:
			--	//check if the object has been locked or not
            if(self.isLocked = 0)
            {
               //check if the dragNdrop script is already running
               if (self.is_dragNdrop = 0)
               {
                  //run the scr_dragNdrop script
                  scr_dragNdrop(objToMove, dragDepth);     
                                          
                  //OR...........
                  
                  //run the scr_dragNdrop_ext script
                  scr_dragNdrop_ext(objToMove, dragDepth, mouseDragIcon, snap_obj, snap_x, snap_y, maxDistX, maxDistY);
               }
            }
